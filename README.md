## Setup

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS. You will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

### Node, Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

if you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

### The React Native CLI

Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Running your React Native application on iOS

Run `react-native run-ios` inside your React Native project folder

## Running your React Native application on Android

### Preparing the Android device

You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.

Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

* Using a physical device
If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable

* Using a virtual Device
If you use Android Studio to open ./AwesomeProject/android, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio.

### Run on Android 
Run `react-native run-android` inside your React Native project folder
